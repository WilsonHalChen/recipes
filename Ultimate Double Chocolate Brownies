½ teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup melted butter, divided
½ cup boiling water
2 cups sugar
2 eggs
1 1/3 cups flour
1 teaspoon vanilla
¼ teaspoon salt
½ cup chopped pecans, optional
12 oz. package chocolate chips*

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine cocoa and baking soda. Blend in 1/3 cup melted butter. Add boiling water and stir until well blended.

Stir in sugar, eggs and remaining butter. Add flour, vanilla, and salt. Stir in nuts (if using) and chocolate chips.

Pour into a greased 9×13 pan and bake at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes.

*(Note: If you prefer your brownies not quite as sweet, you can always scale back on the amount of chocolate chips.)
